## Setup and Build

## Features

### File Reading

### Source Code Compression
input files for compression are stored under `/compressor_input`.
Each file within this directory needs to be a `.c` file for the `compress_and_save` function to process it, otherwise the file is ignored.

output files from compression are stored under `/compressor_output`
Each file within this directory will be a `.bin` file.

input files for decompression are stored under `/compressor_output`, as the input for decompression is the output of compression

output files from decompression are stored under `/decompressor_output`
Each file within this directory will be a `.c` file.
